# Citi Bikes 2020 Tableau Challenge

The purpose of this repository is to hold the Tableau workbook that contians visualizations, dashboards, and story for Citi Bikes in 2020. 

THe background of the visualization is to make sense of the data downloaded from Citi Bikes and understand what is the usage trend in the past year.

We looked at the utilization of bike stations to have an idea of where people are traveling from and to.

We looked at the total number of rides per month to see the riding trend.

And, of course, we looked at the number subscribers versus regular customers to see if anything changed due to the pandemic.
